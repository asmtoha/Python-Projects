# World Population Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global population data to understand population trends, growth patterns, and demographic changes across different countries and regions. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Files
- `world_population_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code
- `world_population_data.csv`: CSV file containing the world population dataset

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- geopandas (optional, for geographical visualizations)

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `world_population_analysis.ipynb`
2. Run the cells in sequence to perform the analysis
3. The notebook contains data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps

## Data Description
The dataset contains information about world population including:
- Country/Region names
- Population statistics
- Growth rates
- Demographic indicators
- Historical population data

## Analysis Steps
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Population trend analysis
4. Regional comparisons
5. Growth rate analysis
6. Demographic pattern identification
7. Visualization of key findings
