# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features and characteristics. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Files
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the prediction model and analysis
- `USA_Housing.csv`: CSV file containing the housing dataset

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (optional, for deep learning models)

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `house_price_prediction.ipynb`
2. Run the cells in sequence to perform the analysis
3. The notebook contains data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps

## Data Description
The dataset contains information about USA housing including:
- Location details
- House size and features
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Year built
- Price information
- Neighborhood characteristics

## Analysis Steps
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering
4. Model selection and training
5. Model evaluation
6. Price prediction
7. Feature importance analysis
8. Visualization of results

## Model Performance
The project includes evaluation metrics such as:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared score
- Cross-validation results
